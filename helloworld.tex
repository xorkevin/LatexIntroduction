\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Preface}
This is the first document that I am writing in latex. I have never touched this tool before but I have heard of many of its good qualities from forums on the internet such as Reddit and the like. Hopefully creating this will show me a new way of doing things.

\subsection{About the document}
\subparagraph{Purpose}
This is a living and breathing document and is subject to further revision and change as I learn more about LaTeX. Hopefully one will be able to see the change as I learn more about this powerful tool.
And without further ado, here we go...

\section{A brief history of LaTeX}

\paragraph{}
It is important to know the story behind the tools that you use. In learning about why and how the tools were developed, we are better able to use them for their intended purposes or perhaps discover new ones.

\subsection{Before LaTeX}
\paragraph{}
Typography has always been an important facet of our human world. Even before the printing press, monks created beautiful manuscripts to document their work and the word of God.
